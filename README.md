**Study Plan for Greek Grammar-First Method**  

### **Phase 1: Articles & Cases**  
1. **Overview of Cases in Modern Greek**  
   - **4 cases**: Nominative, Genitive, Accusative, Vocative (simplified from Ancient Greek).  
   - **Usage**:  
     - **Nominative**: Subject of a sentence.  
     - **Genitive**: Possession, indirect objects, after prepositions (e.g., χωρίς *without*).  
     - **Accusative**: Direct object, motion toward, after prepositions (e.g., με *with*).  
     - **Vocative**: Direct address (rare in formal/business contexts).  

2. **Definite & Indefinite Articles**  
   - **Definite Article Table** (singular/plural):  
     | Case       | Masculine | Feminine | Neuter |  
     |------------|-----------|----------|--------|  
     | Nominative | ο / οι    | η / οι   | το / τα|  
     | Genitive   | του / των | της / των| του / των|  
     | Accusative| το(ν) / τους| τη(ν) / τις| το / τα|  
   - **Indefinite Articles**: ένας (m), μια/μία (f), ένα (n). Decline like adjectives.  
   - **Key Rules**: Articles agree with noun gender, number, and case.

### **DeepSeek Prompts**  
**Prompt 1**:  
```  
Act as my Greek grammar tutor using the attached study plan. Prioritize clear, technical explanations. Follow this structure:  
1. Present a grammar rule.  
2. Provide examples in Greek + English.  
3. Ask me to translate a sentence (EN → EL) applying the rule.  
4. Correct my answer with detailed feedback.  
Today’s focus: Definite articles in genitive case.  
```  

**Prompt 2**:  
```  
You are my Greek verb coach. Teach irregular verbs like πηγαίνω (to go) by:  
1. Listing all tenses (present, aorist, future).  
2. Explaining case requirements (e.g., accusative for destination).  
3. Creating a fill-in-the-blank exercise.  
4. Correcting mistakes with emphasis on aspect (imperfective vs. aorist).  
```  

**Prompt 3**:  
```  
Simulate a business Greek reading exercise. Provide a short legal text (e.g., a contract clause). Ask me to:  
1. Identify the case of underlined nouns.  
2. Parse verbs (tense, voice, mood).  
3. Translate key phrases into English.  
Include Cypriot dialect notes where relevant (e.g., το σπίτιν vs. το σπίτι).  
```
